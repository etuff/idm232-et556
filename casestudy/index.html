            <h2 class="casetitle">Overview</h2>
            <p>
                ReCipe is a custom-built online cookbook web application created for IDM 232 course. 
                The goal of this project was to design and develop a responsive recipe-browsing experience 
                powered by a MySQL database and fully coded with PHP. 
                Over the course of the Alpha, Beta, and Final stages, I designed the interface, documented the system, 
                and built a working platform that allows users to browse,filter search, and explore a full library of recipes.
            </p>

            <p>
                The project tested both my HTML web development skills that i have known and PHP scripting skills which i learned during this term. 
                At the end, I delivered a fully functioning website with templated layouts, search features that filters, and a clean visual system.
            </p>

            <h2 class="casetitle">Context and Challenge</h2>
            <div class="casetext">
                <h2>Background </h2>
                <p>
                    The assignment required me to build a fully custom cookbook web application using only PHP, MySQL, CSS, and Git. Pre-written recipes and images 
                    were provided, but all design decisions, branding, layout, and coding were done independently.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="casetext">
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    The original PDFs were not easy to browse or search and it were not on a central source where everyting would be acessible. 
                    I saw this challenge as an opportunity to transform these static recipe files into a cooking website that lets users filter,
                     explore, and read each recipe quickly.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="casetext">
                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Build a fully responsive cooking website from small to large screens</p></li>
                    <li><p>Convert dozens of recipe PDFs into structured excel file and then MySQL data</p></li>
                    <li><p>Allow users to browse, filter, and search recipes</p></li>
                    <li><p>Deliver the project fully functional by the Final stage</p></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Project Scope</h2>
                <p>This was a solo project in a span of 10 weeks and i was responsible for;</p>

            <div class="casetextb">
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>
                    To understand how users browse recipes, I reviewed patterns from sites like Blue Apron, Half Baked Harvest, 
                    and AllRecipes. I focused on: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Quick scanning</p></li>
                    <li><p>Visual appeal</p></li>
                    <li><p>Clear ingredient and instruction hierarchy</p></li>
                </ul>
                
                
            </div>


            <div class="casetextb">
                <h2>Alpha (HTML Web Dev)</h2>
                <p>HTML based webpage: <a href="https://recipe-c.netlify.app/alpha/" target="_blank">Alpha HTML webpage</a> </p>
                <p>
                    The Alpha phase served as the foundation of the entire project. This stage focused on translating early design 
                    decisions into a working HTML prototype. The goal was not full functionality yet, but instead a clear visual and structural 
                    representation of the final web application.
                </p>
                <p>I built the initial page layouts completely in HTML and CSS and this included defining:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Homepage </p></li>
                    <li><p>Responsive grid structure for the recipe cards</p></li>
                    <li><p>The hero section with a centered search bar</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The focus was on building page templates that would later be converted into dynamic PHP pages, which is why the structure needed to be consistent, reusable, and flexible.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="casetextb">
                <H2>Beta (PHP + MySQL)</H2>
                <p>
                    In Beta, the project shifted from static HTML to a fully dynamic site. Some things i did for the Beta include;
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Built a MySQL database to store all recipe data on my localhost</p></li>
                    <li><p>Created reusable PHP templates</p></li>
                    <li><p>Integrated dynamic content for grids, single recipe pages, and search</p></li>
                    <li><p>Copied the database onto Drexel's Server and connected the website to the database using PHP</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>The goal here was to make the entire project functional enough for submision and feedback.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="casetext">
                <h2>Final</h2>
                <p>
                    The Final Build represents the fully realized version of the ReCipe web application. After establishing structure in 
                    Alpha and full functionality in Beta, the Final stage focused on completing missing features, integrating all recipes, 
                    polishing design details, and ensuring the system performed smoothly on real devices.
                </p>
                <h3>Full Integration of PHP & MySQL</h3>
                <p>
                    The PHP template system created in Beta was fully completed. Every major page pulled live data directly from the MySQL database.
                    Key improvements included;
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Ensuring all recipe cards populate their images, names, and descriptions.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Finalizing logic so all pages respond correctly to various search and filter inputs</p></li>
                    <li><p>Reducing repeated code by consolidating functions and templates.</p></li>
                </ul>
                
            </div>

            <h2 class="casetitle">The Solution</h2>
            <p>
                The final solution is a fully responsive online cookbook web application that transforms a large collection of 
                static recipe PDFs into an easy-to-browse digital experience. The solution brings together the structure defined 
                in Alpha, the functionality built in Beta, and the polish added in the Final build to create a functional and branded cooking platform.

            <h2 class="casetitle">Results</h2>
            <p>
                The final ReCipe web application turned out to be a successful and complete cooking platform 
                that met all the project goals. The biggest improvement was how the site transformed the original PDF recipes 
                into an easy-to-use, searchable experience. Instead of clicking through separate files, users can now 
                browse, search, and open recipes quickly through a clean and organized interface.
            </p>

           <p>
            If I could change anything with the process on this project, I would certainly start the tasks earlier, such as the search system and the database setup, 
            to avoid feeling rushed near the end. I would also spend more time with the structuring of the database. 
            However, these experiences helped strengthen my process, and the final product shows real growth in both my understanding and coding skills.
