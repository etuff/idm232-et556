            <p class="gry">Description</p>
            <p> In this easy recipe, inspired by steak Diane (an American restaurant classic), weʼre
                searing beef medallions, then using the fond in the pan to make a rich, bright mushroom
                sauce for spooning on top. Garlic mashed potatoes and sautéed kale make for delicious,
                simple sides.

                        <p> Heat a medium pot of salted water to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh
                            produce. Large dice the potatoes. Peel the garlic. Using the flat side of your
                            knife, smash 1 clove to flatten. Roughly chop the remaining clove. Peel and
                            thinly slice the shallot. Remove and discard the stems of the kale; roughly
                            chop the leaves. Thinly slice the mushrooms.

                            2 minutes, or until softened and fragrant. Add the mustard, verjus, and 2
                            tablespoons of water (be careful, as the liquid may splatter); season with
                            salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently and scraping up any fond, 30
                            seconds to 1 minute, or until thoroughly combined. Turn off the heat and stir
                            in the remaining butter until melted. (If the sauce seems too thick,
                            gradually add up to 2 tablespoons of water to achieve your desired
                            consistency.) Season with salt and pepper to taste.
