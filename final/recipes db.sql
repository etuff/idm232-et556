On the side, roasted carrots and lightly creamy, golden raisin-studded rice perfectly accent the sweetness of the glaze.', '4 Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breasts*1 Tbsp Ancho Chile Paste*2 Tbsps Crème Fraîche*3 Tbsps Golden Raisins', 'Garlic Press', 'Slicing garlic has never been simpler. This two-sided essential is designed to do two jobs in one: crush garlic and slice it. Made by Harold Import Company, a family-owned American business with over 50 years of experience, this easy-to-use press owes its incredible durability to its heavyweight, stainless steel construction. To use it, simply place the clove in the hopper and press downward for freshly pressed garlic, or flip it over to get uniform slices of garlic. And to ensure minimal mess, it includes a handy cleaning tool for removing leftover pressed garlic after use.', 'Step 1: Cook the rice Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. In a medium pot, combine the rice, a big pinch of salt, and 1 1/2 cups of water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork. Cover to keep warm.*Step 2: Prepare the ingredients & make the glaze While the rice cooks, wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel the carrots; quarter lengthwise, then halve crosswise. Peel and roughly chop the garlic. Remove and discard the stems of the kale; finely chop the leaves. Using a peeler, remove the lime rind, avoiding the white pith; mince to get 2 teaspoons of zest (or use a zester). Halve the lime crosswise. Halve the orange; squeeze the juice into a bowl, straining out any seeds. Whisk in the chile paste and 2 tablespoons of water until smooth.*Step 3: Roast the carrots Place the sliced carrots on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 15 to 17 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.*Step 4: Cook the garlic & kale While the carrots roast, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped garlic and cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the chopped kale; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly wilted. Add 1/3 cup of water; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until the kale has wilted and the water has cooked off. Transfer to the pot of cooked rice. Stir to combine; season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover to keep warm. Wipe out the pan.*Step 5: Cook & glaze the chicken While the carrots continue to roast, pat the chicken dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper on both sides. In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken and cook 4 to 6 minutes on the first side, or until browned. Flip and cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the glaze and cook, frequently spooning the glaze over the chicken, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the chicken is coated and cooked through. Turn off the heat; stir the butter and the juice of 1 lime half into the glaze until the butter has melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.*Step 6: Finish the rice & serve your dish To the pot of cooked rice and kale, add the lime zest, crème fraîche, raisins, and the juice of the remaining lime half. Stir to combine; season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the glazed chicken with the finished rice and roasted carrots. Top the chicken with the remaining glaze from the pan.

Because of its knobby shape, prepping ginger can seem tricky. But simply follow the instructions in this video and you\'ll be prepping like a pro.*Step 1: Prepare & roast the squash Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Using a sharp, sturdy knife, carefully halve the squash lengthwise; using a spoon, scoop out and discard the pulp and seeds. Place in a baking dish, cut side up. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; arrange cut side down. Fill the dish with 1/4 inch of water. Roast 32 to 35 minutes, or until the cut side of the squash is tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.*Step 2: Cook the rice While the squash roasts, in a small saucepan, combine the rice, lime leaf, a big pinch of salt, and 1 cup of water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Turn off the heat. Carefully remove and discard the lime leaf. Fluff the cooked rice with a fork. Cover and set aside in a warm place.*Step 3: Prepare the remaining ingredients While the rice cooks, peel and thinly slice the onion. Peel and finely chop the ginger. Quarter the lime. Cut off and discard the root end of the bok choy; thinly slice crosswise. Pick the mint leaves off the stems; discard the stems.*Step 4: Cook the aromatics While the rice continues to cook, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the sliced onion; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the chopped ginger; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly browned and fragrant.*Step 5: Make the curry To the pan, add the coconut milk (shaking the can just before opening), sugar, and as much of the curry paste as you\'d like, depending on how spicy you\'d like the dish to be; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Turn off the heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.*Step 6: Finish the curry & serve your dish When cool enough to handle, using a fork, scrape the flesh of the roasted squash into a bowl; separate any clumps. (The result should resemble cooked spaghetti.) Discard the skins. Add the squash and sliced bok choy to the pan of curry. Cook on medium-high, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until thoroughly combined. Turn off the heat. Stir in the juice of 2 lime wedges; season with salt and pepper to taste.

As much fun as we had experimenting with this method, we found the best way to test the pasta was, shockingly, by tasting it. In Italian, \"al dente\" means \"to the tooth,\" meaning that it\'s still slightly firm to the bite. As your pasta cooks, periodically (and carefully) taste a piece of it. If it\'s still too firm, let it cook a little longer.*Step 1: Prepare the ingredients Fill a medium pot with water; add a big pinch of salt and heat to boiling on high.

Cook, stirring occasionally, 9 to 11 minutes, or until al dente (still slightly firm to the bite).

Add the seasoned fillets and cook 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until lightly browned and cooked through. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a plate.*Step 5: Make the pan sauce Add the capers, chopped garlic, butter, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan of reserved fond; season with salt and pepper. Cook on medium-high, stirring constantly and scraping up any fond, 1 to 2 minutes, or until browned and fragrant.

Season with salt and pepper to taste.*Step 6: Finish the lentils & serve your dish To the saucepan of cooked lentils, add the roasted broccoli and gremolata.
