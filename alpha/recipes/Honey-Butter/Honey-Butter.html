            <p> This Middle Eastern recipe pairs crispy barramundi—served in a family-friendly pan
                sauce of honey and butter—with a medley of winter vegetables. For savory, herby flavor,
                weʼre seasoning the vegetables with zaʼatar before roasting them.

                    <h3>Large Maple Cutting Board</h3>
                    <p> Built to last, this chopping board is prized by professional chefs and so gorgeous we never want to
                        take it off the counter. Crafted with hardy American maple, this exclusive collaboration between Blue
                        Apron and John Boos & Co. is equal parts beautiful and handy. Its durable surface wonʼt warp and is
                        resistant to scoring; magically, it also helps keep your blades sharper than other materials. Youʼll find
                        these boards in our test kitchen—as well as professional kitchens around the world.

                        <h3>Prepare the ingredients:</h3>
                        <p> Remove the honey from the refrigerator to bring to room temperature. Place
                            an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Wash and dry
                            the fresh produce. Halve the potatoes lengthwise; cut crosswise into 1/4-
                            inch pieces. Peel the carrots; halve lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/2-
                            inch pieces. Cut off and discard the ends of the radishes; quarter lengthwise,
                            then halve crosswise. Quarter and deseed the lemon. Peel and finely chop
                            the garlic; using the flat side of your knife, smash until it resembles a paste
                            (or use a zester). Roughly chop the parsley leaves and stems.

                            tablespoon of olive oil; season with salt, pepper, and the za’atar seasoning.
                            Toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer on one side of the sheet pan. Roast 12
                            to 14 minutes, or until lightly browned. Leaving the oven on, remove from the
                            oven. Place the radish pieces in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and season
                            with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Carefully arrange on the other side of the

                            Remove from the oven. Evenly top with the juice of 2 lemon wedges.
