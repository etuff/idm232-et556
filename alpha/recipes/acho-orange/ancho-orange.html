            <p> Weʼre amping up chicken breasts with a glaze of smoky ancho chile paste and fresh 
                orange juice in this recipe. On the side, roasted carrots and lightly creamy, golden 
                raisin-studded rice perfectly accent the sweetness of the glaze.

                    <h3>Garlic Press</h3>
                    <p> Slicing garlic has never been simpler. This two-sided essential is designed to do two jobs in one:
                        crush garlic and slice it. Made by Harold Import Company, a family-owned American business with
                        over 50 years of experience, this easy-to-use press owes its incredible durability to its heavyweight,
                        stainless steel construction. To use it, simply place the clove in the hopper and press downward for
                        freshly pressed garlic, or flip it over to get uniform slices of garlic. And to ensure minimal mess, it
                        includes a handy cleaning tool for removing leftover pressed garlic after use.

                            water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to

                            is tender. Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork. Cover to keep warm.

                            Remove and discard the stems of the kale; finely chop the leaves. Using a

                            chile paste and 2 tablespoons of water until smooth.
