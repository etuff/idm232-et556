            <p class="gry">Description</p>
            <p> These Italian focaccia sandwiches are layered with broccoli, three cheeses, and a
                savory basil, cashew, and pine nut pesto, then baked in the oven to meld all the bright,
                aromatic flavors. On the side, weʼre serving a refreshing salad of romaine and seasonal
                clementine, dressed in a creamy dressing made with fresh clementine juice.

                    <p> Built to last, this chopping board is prized by professional chefs and so gorgeous we never want to
                        take it off the counter. Crafted with hardy American maple, this exclusive collaboration between Blue
                        Apron and John Boos & Co. is equal parts beautiful and handy. Its durable surface wonʼt warp and is
                        resistant to scoring; magically, it also helps keep your blades sharper than other materials. Youʼll find
                        these boards in our test kitchen—as well as professional kitchens around the world.

                        <p> Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 475°F. Wash and
                            dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the bottom 1/2 inch of the
                            broccoli stem; cut the broccoli into small pieces, keeping the florets intact.
                            Peel and roughly chop the garlic. Halve the focaccia. Grate the asiago
                            cheese on the large side of a box grater. Tear the mozzarella cheese into
                            small pieces. In a bowl, combine the tomato sauce and Italian seasoning;
                            season with salt and pepper to taste.
