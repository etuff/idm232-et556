            <p class="gry">Description</p>
            <p> In this easy recipe, inspired by steak Diane (an American restaurant classic), weʼre
                searing beef medallions, then using the fond in the pan to make a rich, bright mushroom
                sauce for spooning on top. Garlic mashed potatoes and sautéed kale make for delicious,
                simple sides.

                            produce. Large dice the potatoes. Peel the garlic. Using the flat side of your
                            knife, smash 1 clove to flatten. Roughly chop the remaining clove. Peel and
                            thinly slice the shallot. Remove and discard the stems of the kale; roughly
                            chop the leaves. Thinly slice the mushrooms.

                            2 minutes, or until softened and fragrant. Add the mustard, verjus, and 2
                            tablespoons of water (be careful, as the liquid may splatter); season with
                            salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently and scraping up any fond, 30

                            in the remaining butter until melted. (If the sauce seems too thick,
                            gradually add up to 2 tablespoons of water to achieve your desired
                            consistency.) Season with salt and pepper to taste.
