            <p> Made with petite datterini tomatoes, the sauce for tonightʼs bucatini highlights briny
                olives and capers, hot red pepper flakes, and savory Grana Padano cheese. Weʼre
                mixing in roasted broccoli for contrasting texture and nutty-sweet flavor.

                    <p> A stainless steel strainer is a handy tool for quinoa. It's great for draining grains and pastas (not to
                        mention small fruits and vegetables after washing) and straining stocks and gravy. Lightweight and
                        sturdy, itʼs constructed with a double-fine mesh.

                        <h3>How to Make Sure Your Pasta is Al Dente</h3>
                        <p> Nothing beats perfectly cooked, al dente pasta. But how do you know if it's
                            done? There are numerous ways to test the doneness of your noodles when
                            they’re cooking. Some folk wisdom says to throw a piece of pasta against the
                            wall; if it sticks, it's done. As much fun as we had experimenting with this
                            method, we found the best way to test the pasta was, shockingly, by tasting it.
                            In Italian, "al dente" means "to the tooth," meaning that it's still slightly firm
                            to the bite. As your pasta cooks, periodically (and carefully) taste a piece of it.
                            If it's still too firm, let it cook a little longer. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In some of our recipes, we specify to remove the pasta from the pot when it's
                            "just shy of al dente." This is because, later, the pasta will be cooked in a
                            sauce. Removing the pasta from the water just before it's al dente will ensure
                            that the final product isn't overcooked.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Prepare & roast the broccoli:</h3>
                        <p> Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Heat a
                            large pot of salted water to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce.
                            Cut off and discard the bottom 1/2 inch of the broccoli stem; cut the broccoli
                            into small pieces. Place on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with
                            salt, pepper, and up to half the Italian seasoning (you will have extra);
                            toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 22 to 24 minutes, or until
                            browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.
