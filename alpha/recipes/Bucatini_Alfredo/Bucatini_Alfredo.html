            <p> This quick-cooking recipe captures all the deliciously creamy, rich flavor of the classic
                Italian-American sauce—with the welcome addition of quick-braised broccoli. A dusting
                of pecorino cheese completes each bowl with a touch of sharpness.

                    <h3>Stainless Steel Strainer</h3>
                    <p> A stainless steel strainer is a handy tool for quinoa. It's great for draining grains and pastas (not to
                        mention small fruits and vegetables after washing) and straining stocks and gravy. Lightweight and
                        sturdy, itʼs constructed with a double-fine mesh.

                            produce. Cut off and discard the bottom 1/2 inch of the broccoli stem; cut
                            the broccoli into small pieces, keeping the florets intact. Peel and finely chop
                            the garlic.
