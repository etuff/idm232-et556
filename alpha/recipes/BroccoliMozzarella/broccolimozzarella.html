            <p> These calzones are loaded with melty fresh mozzarella, creamy ricotta, and tender
                broccoli—balanced by a tangy tomato dipping sauce. For a refreshing side, weʼre
                tossing crunchy romaine and briny black olives in our take on Caesar dressing.

                            enough time for the dough to rest), you can achieve perfect results at home.

                        <p> Remove the dough from the refrigerator to bring to room temperature. Place
                            an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 475°F. Wash and dry
                            the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the bottom 1/2 inch of the broccoli
                            stem, then roughly chop the broccoli. Peel and roughly chop the garlic. Tear
                            the mozzarella cheese into small pieces. Quarter and deseed the lemon.

                        <p> In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on
                            medium-high until hot. Add the chopped broccoli; season with salt and
                            pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 6 minutes, or until lightly browned.
                            Add 2/3 of the chopped garlic. Cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1
                            minute, or until fragrant. Add 1/4 cup of water; season with salt and
                            pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the broccoli has
                            softened and the water has cooked off. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the
                            mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, half the Italian seasoning, and
                            the juice of 1 lemon wedge; stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper.
                            Wipe out the pan.

                        <p> Lightly oil a sheet pan. Divide the dough into 2 equal-sized portions; using
                            your hands and a rolling pin (or wine bottle), gently stretch and roll the
                            portions into ¼-inch-thick rounds. (If the dough is resistant, let rest for 5
                            minutes.) Divide the filling between the centers of the rounds; fold each
                            round in half over the filling. Using a fork, crimp the edges of the dough to
                            seal. Transfer to the sheet pan. Using a fork, poke a few holes across the tops
                            of the calzones to vent. Lightly drizzle the calzones with olive oil. Bake 16 to
                            18 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand
                            for at least 2 minutes.

                            the remaining lemon wedges, and a drizzle of olive oil. Season with salt
