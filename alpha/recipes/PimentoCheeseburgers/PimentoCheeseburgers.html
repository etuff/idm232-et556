            <p> Tonight, the classic cheeseburger gets an easy, Southern-style lift from pimento cheese
                —a zesty spread made with cheddar, mayo, pickled peppers, and spices. Weʼre serving
                our burgers with sweet potato oven fries for a flavorful, seasonal twist on the usual side.

                        <h3>Sweet Potato</h3>
                        <p> Despite its name, the sweet potato is not related to the group of vegetables we
                            know as “potatoes”—rather, the sweet potato is actually a member of the
                            morning glory family. Columbus brought the tropical root crop back to
                            Europe from the Americas. It was eagerly adopted by Europeans and given
                            the title of “potato” (from the indigenous Taino name, “batata”). Years later,
                            in 1537, when the white potato first arrived in Europe, locals began referring
                            to both vegetables as “potatoes,” creating a confusion that persists today.
                            Sweet potatoes are enjoyed in both regular and "baby" varieties—smaller
                            versions of the vegetable that are renowned for their sweet flavor and tender
                            flesh.

                        <p> Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Wash and
                            dry the fresh produce. Cut the sweet potato lengthwise into 1-inch wedges.
                            Transfer to a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and
                            pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer, skin side down. Roast 21 to 23
                            minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Set aside in a
                            warm place.
